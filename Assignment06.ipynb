They package their food as best they can to reduce sogginess which is expected when you order hot fried foods (side eyeing reviews that whine about their hot food producing condensation in a container). I just pop half my order into a toaster oven for a few min to re-crisp; no big deal. The last time I ordered delivery, the fries were still crispy and hot!

If the movie had been fast-paced, that essential aspect of Chiron's identity would be lost.\",\n",

    "I think that I could pick out 2 groups of movies from the words given. The first would be classic movies, and the second would be comedic high school / school related movies. Classic movies are generally not all dramas (ie not all dramas are classic), but thinking about the 5 movies I selected as dramas, they were almost all considered \"classics\" so it does make sense that the words \"cult\" and \"classic\" were used to identify that category. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as for my specific taste, the comedies I chose (booksmart, clueless, mean girls, 21 jump street, lady bird) 5/5 are set in high school so it makes sense that school is mentioned pretty often in that category (student, high as in high school probably, transfer are all mentioned). But for comedies, charm is mentioned, and I do think that it's pretty common for a charming character to occur in comedies over dramas. But on the flip side, chemistry is mentioned for the \"comedy\" category, but chemistry seems to be important in all movies, drama or comedy. Also, the word \"fun\" is associated with the \"classics\" category that I thought was more corresponding to \"drama\", but I would think that comedies are more fun. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some words that didn't seem to make sense in that category. My review I selected for Clueless was a little longer than the other reviews which seemed to skew the results as clueless and silverston (meaning Alicia Silverstone, actress in Clueless), and they ended up in the category that I thought would be \"comedy\" despite probably not being universal words.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I think that this 2 topic analysis was not very good. The main issues for this analysis not doing well are probably because of the small sample size, and because I picked my favorite movies, which fit into specific genres and not a broader sense of comedies vs drama. For example, I view Lady Bird as a comedy but I'm sure many think it's a drama. Addiitonally, \n",
