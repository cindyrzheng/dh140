## description of dh140
DH 140 is a course at UCLA, titled "Coding for Humanities". The goal of this course is to teach how to code in Python, and using our Python skills, how to use that as a tool applied to humanities fields. Some specifics to expect during this course are data anaylsis, visualization and description through Python of humanities fields. 

## project ideas 
i am super interested in linguistic analysis. some potential projects i was thinking about: 
1. song lyric sentiment analysis in comparision to how upbeat the song is- would use spotify api and sentiment analysis of the song lyrics 
2. comparing 2 different translations of the same piece of text, preferably a book. 

## my objectives for this class 
in this class, i hope to develop strong data analysis, visualization and decription skills. i also hope to create projects that are related to humanities fields that i am interested in and also projects that i am proud of and would want to show my friends and family.
